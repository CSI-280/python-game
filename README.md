# Rogue: Apocalypse

## Overview

Info about the game, maybe add story context if we have any

## Installation

This game requires python 3.8 or higher as well as the tcod library.

### Python installation

Head to <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and follow instructions to install.

### Tcod installation on Windows (non virtual environment)

Run the following code in a command-line to install tcod on your computer.

```bash
py -m pip install tcod
```

### Tcod installation on PyCharm (virtual environment)

#### Upgrade pip using the command

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Install tcod using the command

```bash
pip install tcod
```

If tcod fails to install you may need to download and install visual c++ from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

If you need help, this tutorial from the library's page is very helpful and where I got the information on how to install it in the first place.
