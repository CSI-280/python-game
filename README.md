# Installation

You'll need to install libtcod to run this project.

### On Windows (non virtual environment)

Run the following code in a command-line to install tcod on your computer
```
py -m pip install tcod
```

### PyCharm (virtual environment)

1. Upgrade pip using the command
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

2. Install tcod using the command
```
pip install tcod
```

If you need help, this tutorial from the library's page is very helpful and where I got the information on how to install it in the first place.
