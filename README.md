# Rogue: Apocalypse

## Overview

Apocalypse is a rouge-like game where you can explore dungeons. In these dungeons you will be fighting many kinds of monsters and collecting items as you search for the stairs to get to the next floor of the dungeon to try and clear the dungeon.

## Installation

This game requires python 3.8 or higher as well as the tcod library.

### Python installation

Head to <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and follow instructions to install.

### Tcod installation on Windows (non virtual environment)

Run the following code in a command-line to install tcod on your computer.

```bash
py -m pip install tcod
```

### Tcod installation on PyCharm (virtual environment)

#### Upgrade pip using the command

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Install tcod using the command

```bash
pip install tcod
```

If tcod fails to install you may need to download and install visual c++ from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

If you need help, this tutorial from the library's page is very helpful and where I got the information on how to install it in the first place.
