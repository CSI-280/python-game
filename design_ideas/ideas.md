# Design Ideas

Here is a list of a bunch of ideas that I came up with for our game. If anyone has more ideas feel free to add them.

## Core Systems

1. Puzzles
   * Environmental
     * Look for clues to solve a riddle
     * Do something in one room and it affects another
   * Problem Solving
     * Move something to somewhere else
     * The grain chicken fox problem
     * Math
   * Item based
     * Find a certain item to unlock a door
     * Feed carrot to horse to solve puzzle
   * Reward at end of puzzle
     * gold/items
     * something to make it worth doing a puzzle
  
2. Movement
   * WASD
   * Potential for alternative movement options?
     * Jumping
     * Running
     * Teleporting

3. Player Character
   * Inventory
     * Armour
     * Weapons
     * Healing Items?
     * Potions?
   * Stats/levels?
4. Combat
   * HP
   * Melee, ranged, or both?
   * Upgrades/different weapons
   * Enemies
     * Design multiple difficulty tiers of enemies
     * Potential for scaling enemies
   * Looting fallen enemies?

5. Level Generation
   * Random or Psuedo-random generation
   * Build "buckets" of rooms to add to floor
     * Buckets would hold things like dungeons and arenas that have a set layout
   * Floor themes
     * Could have a forest floor or an ice floor etc. and enemies/puzzles are based upon the theme.

## Additional features/topics

1. Goal
   * What is the player trying to do?
   * Find a magic item?
   * Save a village?
   * Ascend to godhood?
   * Worth discussing end goal/motivation for player

2. Graphics
   * Stick to only ASCII?
     * Different color options besides plain white?
   * Maybe add some simple sprites?
